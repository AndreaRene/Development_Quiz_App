# Coding and Development Quiz

In this application I wanted to create a quiz that students could use to judge their learning progress. You can find the application [here](https://andrearene.github.io/Development_Quiz_App/) I wrote it to meet the following criteria:

* A quiz that tests knowledge of current and past lessons in the course
* An interface that is intuitive for users
* An easy identifier when a student selects a correct or incorrect answer
* A quiz that progresses intuitively as questions are answered
* A scoreboard that will store the top scores so that students can compare their progress to their peers
* An application that is easily scaleable and expandable to a variety of subjects
* A simple and clean interface with a responsive design that accomodates screen sizes ranging from 320px to 1920px

## Technology Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
