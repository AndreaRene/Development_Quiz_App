 AS A coding boot camp student
 I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
 SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

 GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
     quiz section 
         section header with quiz title
         section paragraph with quiz instructions

 WHEN I click the start button
     section footer
         create start button element in html
             create event listener for button click
             call function to start "quiz"

 THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
     header element in html
         timer display inside header
             displays only while quiz is running
     create timer function in js
     replace section header element text with question
         hidden before quiz starts
         write question array in js
     replace paragraph with answer selections 
         hidden before quiz starts
         write answer arrays in js

 WHEN I answer a question
     answer selections will be clickable buttons
    need event listener for click
             color change on click
                 correct - green
                 incorrect - red minus 10sec
             created in js
                 figure out loop to dynamically create buttons from question array
                 else create 4 buttons 

 THEN I am presented with another question
     replace current question with another question from the array
         use text content
     replace current answer array with answer array corresponding to new question
         use text content

 WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

 THEN time is subtracted from the clock
     global var minus10 that 
         needs to reset after score is subtracted


 WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
     add end quiz function that stops timer if there is time left
         needs to go into the runquiz function and the run timer function

 THEN the game is over
    replace questions with score
         time left equals score



 WHEN the game is over

 THEN I can save my initials and score
     replace answer buttons with input for initials, save button, restart quiz button
     store scores and initials in local storage
     replace score text with high scores
     replace buttons with high score list (5 scores) and reset high scores button
        reset high scores - local storage clear function
